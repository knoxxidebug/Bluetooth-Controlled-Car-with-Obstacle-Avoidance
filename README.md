# Bluetooth-Controlled-Car-with-Obstacle-Avoidance
A Bluetooth-controlled car with obstacle avoidance combines robotics, sensors, and wireless communication. It can be steered via Bluetooth and navigate autonomously using sensors to detect and avoid obstacles, making it a fun project to learn microcontrollers, programming, and electronics.
